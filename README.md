# babel-py
Welcome to build Babel.py!

_Let us hope that we can succeed this time, with LLM translating our distinct languages_

This repo is the python local backend for Babel, the desktop copilot for Unity Engine

## Architecture for the whole product
+ Frontend (GUI): Electron; in `another repo` I haven't created yet
+ Frontend (command-line, test): terminal_input.py; in `this repo`
+ Backend: python; in `this repo`
